# Compare

## Overview

Compare AI is an app that allows you to ask questions and view a summarized output of many of the top LLM's. You can ask it hotly debated questions with a lot of subjectivey, or just ask questions that you think would be interesting to see answered by many of the top LLMs. The inspiration for this is that people often ask many different LLM's the same quetsion to compare/double check answers. This eliminates the extra effort/cost.

## Setup
You will need to populate .env's in the frontend and backend. Just follow the formats of the .env.examples. 
Next, to run the backend navigate to backend, run `pip install -r requirements.txt` and then run `uvicorn app.main:app`.
